# Release 12

{: .important }
> Due to addition of a dedicated device identification handler class all existing custom modules will have to be modified. The modification requires the straight forward change of the decorators.
>
> ```python
> t16000 = gremlin.input_devices.JoystickDecorator(
>     "T16000.M",
>     72331539,
>     "Default"
> )
> ```
>
> needs to be replaced with
>
> ```python
> t16000 = gremlin.input_devices.JoystickDecorator(
>     "T16000.M",
>     gremlin.common.DeviceIdentifier(72331539, 2),
>     "Default"
> )
> ```
>
> The benefit of this is that no matter whether or not you use duplicate devices the code is the same and it allows the implementation of a forthcoming feature.

## New Features
- Reworked automatic update of profile device information to account for windows id changes
- New tool to move configuration from (unused) devices to other devices *Tools -> Swap Devices*
- Map to mouse now supports button clicks and more motion control
- Option to enable profile on launch
- Option added to switch between tabs based on physical device usage
- Unified handling of device identities to prevent issues when moving between duplicate / non-duplicate setups
- Containers are now considered valid if they can be partially executed

## Fixes
- Fix offset by one bug in the axis calibration usage
- Don't ignore injected keyboard events as that breaks conditions etc.
- Make value input boxes behave correctly with different decimal place character
- Save profiles as UTF-8 to prevent issues with non ASCII characters
- More robust recovery of vJoy device ownership
- Input viewer should now show hat activations of very short duration
- Response curves save changes when inverting the curve
- More robust reading and writing of XML profiles
- Handle device changes while Gremlin is active
- Better handling of incompatible inputs in the UI
- Reworked input device detection and handling logic
- vJoy default value should be properly set again
- Fix Gremlin not terminating if vJoy issues are encountered
- Detect and handle a bunch of scenarios that would cause Gremlin to crash previously
