# Release 9

## New Features
- Support for action sets, i.e. collection of actions in a single container
- Activation conditions for either individual actions or entire containers, triggering based on the action state itself or the state of other inputs
- UI rework to display the various pieces of information without overloading the entire UI
- Code generation from profiles redone completely
- Macros can now record joystick actions and vJoy actions with timing information
- No operation action added to use when no action is desired but one is needed (Tempo container)
- Customizable activation condition for short presses in the Tempo container

## Fixes
- Should no longer crash on media key usage (can't use them yet)
- Properly release vJoy devices when they are not in use
- Value entry boxes should now be less annoying to use
- Reading XML profiles should be a bit more robust now
- Update SDL to the current version 2.0.6
- Response curve input field changes should now be stored again
- Crash due to activation race condition fixed
- Input repeater and input highlighting code improved to work better with axes that don't physically reset to center
- Cheatsheet generation should no longer crash when no save file is provided
- Logging added for vJoy and SDL device matching, to help debug mapping issues in the future
- Somewhat improve the "Do you want to save these changes" dialog logic
- vJoy response curves should once again apply properly
- Fixed macro manager to prevent excessive polling when identical macros are queued up
