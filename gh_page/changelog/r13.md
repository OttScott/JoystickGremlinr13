# Release 13

{: .important }
> Due to the change in input handling library existing custom modules will no longer work, as they now require the GUID.
>
> ```python
> t16000 = gremlin.input_devices.JoystickDecorator(
>     "T16000.M",
>     gremlin.common.DeviceIdentifier(72331539, 2),
>     "Default"
> )
> ```
>
> needs to be replaced with
>
> ```python
> t16000 = gremlin.input_devices.JoystickDecorator(
>     "T16000.M",
>     "{a48e6486-ba2f-457d-945b-7c684b9ec7e7}",
>     "Default"
> )
> ```
>
> The new library should solve certain issues with SDL2 and more importantly no longer ever get confused about the identity of devices. If identical devices are present Gremlin will require the user to use the Device Swap tool to properly assign their inputs.
