# Getting Help

Joystick Gremlin can be complex and confusing especially when one starts out using it. While the documentation tries to provide enough information to get started with the program this can at times be insufficient. In those cases it might be faster and less frustrating to ask someone for help or to explain something.

The best way for interactive help is the [HOTAS Discord](https://discord.gg/hotas){:target="_blank"} where there is a #joystick-gremlin channel where people tend to answer questions quickly. Another option is the [HOTAS subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hotas){:target="_blank"} where I try to asnwer posts relating to Gremlin and others do the same. Finally, you can also use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/WhiteMagic/JoystickGremlin/discussions){:target="_blank"} to ask questions.

For some of the more frequently asked questions te [FAQ](/help/faq) may hold the answer.
