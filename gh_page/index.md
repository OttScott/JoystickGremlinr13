# Joystick Gremlin

Joystick Gremlin is a program that allows the configuration of joystick like devices, similar to what CH Control Manager and Thrustmaster's T.A.R.G.E.T. do for their respectively supported joysticks. However, Joystick Gremlin works with any device be it from different manufacturers or custom devices that appear as a joystick to Windows. Joystick Gremlin uses the virtual joysticks provided by vJoy to map physical to virtual inputs and apply various other transformations such as response curves to analogue axes. In addition to customizing joysticks, Joystick Gremlin also provides powerful macro functionalities, a flexible mode system, scripting using Python, and many other features.

The main features are:

- Works with arbitrary joystick like devices
- User interface for common and some not so common configuration tasks
- Merging of multiple physical devices into a single virtual device
- Axis response curve and dead zone configuration
- Mapping of joystick inputs to keyboard and mouse inputs
- Powerful and flexible macro system
- Arbitrary number of modes with inheritance and customizable mode switching
- Conditional execution of configured actions
- Python scripting support for unlimited customization

There are a few other tools which provide some of the above features, including:

- [Universal Control Remapper](https://github.com/Snoothy/UCR){:target="_blank"} (successor to UJR)
- [FreePie](https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/){:target="_blank"}
- [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/){:target="_blank"}
- [Universal Joystick Remapper](https://github.com/evilC/AHK-Universal-Joystick-Remapper){:target="_blank"}
- Joystick Curves (defunct)

Compared to Joystick Gremlin the above tools, with the exception of UCR, either have limited functionality due to being intended for a more specific task or require more manual coding as they are a more general purpose tool.  As such Joystick Gremlin sits somewhere in between and aims to provide a complete package for simple as well as advanced configuration and management of joysticks.
