# User scripts

## The `user_scripts` directory

This directory is provided for developers to store their user scripts. The recommended workflow is:

1.  Fork Joystick Gremlin on GitHub.
2.  Create a separate branch in GitHub for all your scripts.
3.  When developing scripts, modern IDEs should be able to help with autocompletion.
4.  You can also setup the dev environment and run Gremlin to perform deeper debugging.

Rebase that branch on top of the main branch as needed.

### example.py

This is an example script that shows how to use the user script API.
